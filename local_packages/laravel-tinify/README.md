The package simply provides a Tinify facade that acts as a wrapper to the [tinify/tinfiy-php](https://github.com/tinify/tinify-php)

It was originaly developed by [Marvin OÃŸwald](https://github.com/marvinosswald/laravel-tinify)

I added functionality to use of laravel bulit in config cache helper which was having issues of returning null when configs are cached via `php artisan config:cache` because it was directly loading via `env` helper.
So, I converted it to use the api_key from config which can be defined to load from `env` and still use the 
`php artisan config:cache command` and it works.

### For Laravel < 5.5, please use the [1.0.2 Tag](https://github.com/msonowal/laravel-tinify/tree/1.0.2)!
